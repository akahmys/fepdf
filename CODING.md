# 💻 fepdf Coding Standards & Hardening Protocol

This document defines the coding conventions, safety standards (**RR-15 Protocol**), and architectural patterns required across all crates in the fepdf workspace.

## 🛡️ 1. The RR-15 Hardening Rules

Derived from aerospace safety principles, the **RR-15 (Reliable Rust-15)** rules guarantee determinism, memory safety, and absolute runtime reliability.

### Rule Summary Matrix

| Rule | Area | Requirement | Enforcement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Rule 1** | Function Length | Max 50 lines for standard functions.<br>Max 200 lines for `// RR-15 Limit: GUI`.<br>Max 500 lines for `// RR-15 Limit: Dispatcher`. | `./scripts/audit/verify_compliance.sh` |
| **Rule 2** | Panic Prevention | `unwrap()` and `expect()` are forbidden in production code. Use `?` or `unwrap_or()`. | Automated grep check |
| **Rule 3** | Unsafe Ban | `unsafe` blocks are forbidden (`workspace.lints.rust.unsafe_code = "forbid"`). | Rustc lint |
| **Rule 4** | Control Flow | Avoid deep nesting (`if let` / `match`). Prefer early return with `?`. | Code review / Clippy |
| **Rule 5** | Match Exhaustiveness | Wildcard arms (`_ =>`) are forbidden when matching a **domain enum**. Named exceptions below. | `clippy::wildcard_enum_match_arm` via `verify_compliance.sh` |
| **Rule 6** | Stack Safety | Unbounded recursion is forbidden. Use heap-based loops with `Vec`. | Code review |
| **Rule 7** | Global State | `static mut` and global mutable state are forbidden. | Automated grep check |
| **Rule 8** | Invalid State | Use type-safe `enum` states instead of boolean flags or nested `Option`s. | Architecture review |
| **Rule 10** | Determinism | `HashMap` and `HashSet` are forbidden in core pipelines. Use `BTreeMap`, `BTreeSet`, or `PdfArena`. | Automated grep check |
| **Rule 11** | Error Transparency | Return typed `thiserror` enums. String-based errors (`Result<T, String>`) are forbidden in core APIs. | Automated grep check |
| **Rule 13** | Error Swallowing | `filter_map(Result::ok)` and silent error swallowing are forbidden. | Automated grep check |
| **Rule 14** | Test Code Separation | Standalone/Integration tests MUST be placed in `crates/*/tests/`. Do NOT pollute `src/` with dedicated test files. | Directory structure check |
| **Rule 15** | Clone Optimization | Avoid excessive `.clone()`. Use `Arc` or handle references where appropriate. | Code review / Density warning |
| **Rule 17** | Type Explicitly | Explicitly specify floating-point types (`1.0_f32`, `2.5_f32`) to prevent Edition 2024 inference fallbacks. | Clippy / Compiler |
| **Rule 19** | Formatting | The tree must satisfy `cargo fmt --all --check`. | `./scripts/audit/verify_compliance.sh` |
| **Rule 20** | Recorded Interpretation | Where the engine accepts input the standard does not describe, it MUST record a `Decision` naming the clause and what was done. A silent acceptance is a defect even when the output is right. | Code review / ARCHITECTURE.md §5.3 |

### Rule 5 in detail: what "no wildcards" can and cannot mean

The point of Rule 5 is that **adding a variant must break the build at every place
that decides on it**, rather than silently falling into a catch-all. That property is
only achievable — and only worth anything — for enums we own and expect to grow.

A blanket ban is not implementable. Matching on `&str`, `u8` or `usize` *requires* a
wildcard, because the domain is open. There are 193 syntactic `_ =>` arms in this
workspace (2026-08-16), and how many are of that kind cannot be established by reading
the text — which is the argument, not a gap in it. Telling the two apart needs to know
what the scrutinee's type is. So enforcement uses `clippy::wildcard_enum_match_arm`,
which has that information and fires only on enums.

**Forbidden** — wildcard arms over domain enums such as `ColorSpaceKind`,
`SublimatedData`, `Color`, `PixelFormat`, and any enum added from here on. These gain
variants as features land, and a catch-all turns "unsupported colour space" into
"silently renders black".

**Exempt** — the following are named in `verify_compliance.sh`:

| Type | Why |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Object`, `Token`, `Command`, `IrObject`, `RefinedObject` | Mirror the ISO 32000-2 object and operator taxonomy, whose variant set is fixed by the standard. They are matched at dozens of sites that care about one or two variants; spelling out all 11 `Object` variants at each would add ~220 lines and push functions past the Rule 1 limit for no safety gain. |
| `syn::Data`, `syn::Fields` | Owned by an external crate and `#[non_exhaustive]`. Exhaustive matching is impossible. |

`Self` is exempt only in the three files whose `match self` is over an exempt type,
listed explicitly in the script. A `match self` on a new domain enum anywhere else
still fails the audit.

Adding a type to the exemption list is a deliberate act: it belongs in this table with
its reason, not as an inline `#[allow]`.

## 🏛️ 2. What code must satisfy elsewhere

This document says what code must satisfy. The design it satisfies lives in
`ARCHITECTURE.md`, and repeating it here is how the two came to disagree: this section
described a **Pass 1 (Arena Ingestion)** that [ADR-0003] removed when the reader stopped
converting another library's object model, and it had said so for as long as the reader
had been fepdf's own.

- **The Sublimation Pipeline** — `ARCHITECTURE.md` §5.4. A `Document` is the normalised
  state, not the file; the file is reached through the byte layer named in the same
  section.
- **`PdfArena` invariants** — `ARCHITECTURE.md` §5.6. Objects are reached through
  `Handle<Object>`, never a pointer or a raw index, and traversal is deterministic
  (Rule 10 above is the enforced half of this).
- **Rendering and the GUI** — `ARCHITECTURE.md` §5.7. Vello compute shaders on wgpu,
  `f64` preserved through path snapping and measurement, CJK font loading and
  English/Japanese localisation in `fepdf-gui`.
